## General info
This project is a web-based calculator that can do simple math equations, done as an assignment from The Odin Project.
The purpose of this project, was to test my overall skills of the front-end technologies.
This project consisted of me doing a ton of googling and looking through documentations to figure out how certain things work and how to achieve a desirable output.
By completing this project I've learnt a lot about event listeners and how they interact with the DOM.
